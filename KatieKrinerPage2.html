			<h2>Her Story</h2>
			<p>Mrs. Liptak’s story starts some time ago when she was a troubled teen that got mixed up in illegal hacking. Liptak became very good at hacking and became popular among the hacking community. However these were not the only ones who began to notice her. One day  when she skipped school and went to the park, she was approached by a man. He gave her a contact card and told her that the FBI was interested in her abilities. She shrugged it off as a joke at first but curiosity got the best of her and she decided to contact the number on the card. To her surprise it was legit and she received a job offer in the FBI computer science division. Thus began her long and exciting FBI career.</p><br>
		
			<p>During her career she helped to prevent many cyber attacks from taking place and helped the FBI to gather intelligence for ongoing cases. She quickly became widely known across many agencies and recieved many job offers from them. However, Liptak turned them all down because she enjoyed working for the FBI. She later began to go to many different places around country providing surveillance and technical assistance to agents who were in the field and became a highly regarded agent within the agency. Liptak eventually was tasked with her latest assignment which is being an undercover agent gathering intel on the youths of America as a teacher. She uses her FBI training to brainwash her students and make them become interested in computer science and web design to help supply the FBI with future prospects trained by the best.</p><br>

			<h2>My Story</h2>
			<p>Now you may be thinking, “how could any of this possibly be true?” Allow me to share some things with you that I have noticed throughout the past two years but even more specifically this year. Last year when I was in computer science the school year started out with a nice teacher named Mr. Coates and he was only there for about two or three weeks when all of a sudden he said that his circumstances changed and he  could no longer teach the class. Then we got our new teacher and guess who it was. It was Mrs. Liptak! I believe that the FBI intervened and placed Mr. Coates elsewhere so that they could place her into her new undercover operation. As that school year went on I became more and more suspicious that there was more to her than just being our teacher. Then it happened. Her FBI ID surfaced in the class and there was no doubt in my mind anymore. She was definitely an undercover agent working for the FBI. Now that I was convinced I felt it was my duty to convince others, so I made it my mission to start collecting more serious proof this year.</p><br>
		
			<h2>My Proof</h2>
	
			<ul>
				<li>On October 17th she held a student vote for a design company name which was obviously a ploy for the FBI to see what names students like the most so they can use it in their future plans for us.</li>
				<li>On January 18th she openly agreed to look into a suspicious person that another student and I came across in another class, thus hinting at the fact that she is in the FBI.</li>

		</div>
				<li>I had another occurrence of proof in regards to attempted brainwashing through use of different colored shapes, but I lost the date and time of when this occurred due to my computer having a technical issue, which undoubtedly was the FBI trying to cover their tracks and thwart my proof gathering.</li>
				<li>There have also been multiple occasions throughout the year that she has taken a certain student aside in a private room who has openly admitted to wanting to work for the FBI in the future. There is no telling what they have been talking about in there, but there is no doubt that it has to do with the FBI in some way.</li>
			</ul><br>
		
			<h2>The Window</h2>
			<p>Last year Mrs. Liptak would repeatedly get distracted by what she claimed was her “window.” It is my belief that this window was actually a screen in which the FBI directly communicates with her and gives her instructions on what to say to us during the class. She would always come up with the excuse that there was a squirrel outside her window, which I have logically concluded to be her codename for the FBI. Last year she also made the mistake of screen sharing without minimizing all of her windows and everyone could clearly see the script that she is given by the FBI which she quickly closed and pretended was not there.</p><br>
			<p>Here is a table with all other code words that she has been known to use and their meanings.</p><br>
